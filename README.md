# Cardiovascular Treatment Evolution & Smoking: A Personal Data Analysis Project

## Summary
This project explores how cardiovascular treatments have evolved over the decades, particularly in relation to smoking and other risk factors. It uses publicly available datasets and merges them into a clean, harmonized dataset to analyze patterns in intervention types, age, and lifestyle risk factors.  

The project is deeply personal to me: I come from a family with a strong history of smoking and cardiovascular disease. My grandfather underwent a long, invasive bypass surgery that left a scar from his heart to his calf. My father, after a heart attack, had a painless stent installed without open surgery. My uncle had two major surgical interventions — one at his heart and another at his calf. Seeing these differences sparked my curiosity: how has treatment evolved? How do smoking and other risk factors influence what intervention patients receive today? This project is my way of investigating these questions through real-world data.

## Method
1. **Data Collection**
   - Three publicly available cardiovascular datasets were obtained. These include patient-level information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status, and treatment outcomes.

2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**
   - Variables were standardized across datasets to ensure comparability.
   - Missing values were handled appropriately.
   - Datasets were merged into a single **processed dataset** for analysis.

3. **Analysis**
   - **Descriptive Statistics:** Examined smoking prevalence and patient demographics.
   - **Correlation Analysis:** Explored the association between smoking and intervention type, and age and intervention type.
   - **Trend Analysis:** Investigated how cardiovascular treatments have shifted over decades, from invasive bypass surgeries to minimally invasive stents, and increasing preventive and pharmacological approaches.
   - **Predictive Modeling:** Conceptually explored how risk factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking status influence treatment type.

4. **Interpretation**
   - Patterns were interpreted using tables and conceptual reasoning, linking risk factors to intervention intensity and highlighting the evolution of care over time.

## Key Insights
- **Smoking and Age Matter:** Smokers and older patients are more likely to receive invasive treatments, while younger non-smokers are more often managed conservatively.
- **Treatment Evolution:** Over the decades, surgical bypass procedures have declined in frequency, replaced by less invasive interventions such as stents. Pharmacological and preventive strategies have also increased in prominence.
- **Family Connection:** The patterns in the datasets reflect what I’ve personally observed in my family: treatment has become less invasive and more targeted, aligning with individual risk profiles.
- **Preventive Potential:** Early identification of risk factors like high blood pressure and smoking can reduce the need for invasive procedures, emphasizing the importance of preventive care.
